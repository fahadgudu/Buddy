Buddy Memory Allocator

Memory management, specially memory allocation to processes, is a fundamental issue in operating systems. A fixed partitioning scheme limits the number of active processes and may use space inefficiently if there is a poor match between available partition sizes and process sizes. A dynamic partitioning scheme is more complex to maintain and includes the overhead of compaction. An interesting compromise is the buddy system. In a buddy system, the entire memory space available for allocation is initially treated as a single block whose size is a power of 2. When the first request is made, if its size is greater than half of the initial block then the entire block is allocated. Otherwise, the block is split in two equal companion buddies. If the size of the request is greater than half of one of the buddies, then allocate one to it. Otherwise, one of the buddies is split in half again. This method continues until the smallest block greater than or equal to the size of the request is found and allocated to it. In this method, when a process terminates the buddy block that was allocated to it is freed. Whenever possible, an unnallocated buddy is merged with a companion buddy in order to form a larger free block. Two blocks are said to be companion buddies if they resulted from the split of the same direct parent block
